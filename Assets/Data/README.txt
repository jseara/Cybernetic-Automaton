Assignment 1

HOW TO RUN:
    .exe exists within this folder:
        /bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/win10-x64/Assignment\ 1.exe 
    
    Just double click and it should RUN

TESTING STRATEGY:
    The testing strategy was to emulate the conditions of the skinner box found in Chapter 5 of the dissertation, using its given values and starting state.
    The goal was to attempt to reach a similar end state to what was shown, which would demonstrate a well-written machine.

NOTES:
    The automata isn't completed, I only managed to code up to Step 8 when I ran out of time.  The rest of the algorithm is documented in pseudocode, if 
    that helps demonstrate my knowledge of the underlying ideas.
